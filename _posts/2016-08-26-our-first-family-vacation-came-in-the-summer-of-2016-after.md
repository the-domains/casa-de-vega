  Our first family vacation came in the Summer of 2016. After vetting out
  several options for our first big trip, Disney World rose to the top of our
  minds and lists. Florida would be a new destination for us all and it was a
  great opportunity to not only see a different part of the country, but to
  experience the Magic Kingdom in a way we never had.
